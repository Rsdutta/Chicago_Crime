Run pip3 install requirements.txt

To run the kmeans clustering and heat map generation, first run table_setup_2.py. The results for the clustering map and heatmap will be in total_crimes.html and time_heatmap.py respectively. 

To get the error vs k graph and clustering scatter plot from matplotlib run graph.py. The results will be in k_plot.png and kmeans_plot.png respectively. (Done locally since cluster does not support matplotlib for some reason)

To get the route_comparison.txt file, run routing.py and the result will be in the aforementioned file. In order to customize routing from point a and point b, change lat1, lon1, lat2, and lon2 parameters in the file. 

Descriptions for all of these results are in the results section of the final report.
